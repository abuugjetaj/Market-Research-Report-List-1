<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fishmeal Feed Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steam Dried(SD)</li><li>Flame Dried(FD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fishmeal feed market primarily consists of two types: Steam Dried (SD) and Flame Dried (FD) fishmeal. SD fishmeal is produced using steam heat, preserving more nutrients and resulting in a higher protein content, making it ideal for aquaculture and animal feed. In contrast, FD fishmeal is dried using direct flame, which can enhance its shelf life but may reduce nutrient levels. Both types cater to different requirements in the animal and aquaculture industries based on nutritional needs and cost considerations.</p></p>
