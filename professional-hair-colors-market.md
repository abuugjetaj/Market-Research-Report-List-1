<p><strong>The Professional Hair Colors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temporary Hair Dye</li><li>Semi-permanent Hair Dye</li><li>Permanent Hair Dye</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The professional hair color market comprises three key types: temporary, semi-permanent, and permanent hair dyes. Temporary hair dyes provide short-term color that washes out after a few washes, ideal for experimentation. Semi-permanent dyes last longer, typically fading over several weeks, offering a vibrant look without the commitment of permanent options. Permanent hair dyes penetrate the hair shaft for long-lasting color that endures until new hair growth appears, providing full coverage for grays and allowing dramatic color changes.</p></p>
