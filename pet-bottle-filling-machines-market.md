<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET Bottle Filling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Contact Valve</li><li>With Contact Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PET bottle filling machines are essential in beverage packaging, categorized into two main types: without contact valve and with contact valve. Machines without contact valves operate by creating a flow path that avoids direct contact with the liquid, minimizing contamination and allowing for high-speed filling. In contrast, machines with contact valves ensure liquid passes through a valve that makes direct contact, enhancing precision in filling but potentially increasing the risk of contamination if not properly maintained. Both types serve specific industry needs.</p></p>
